## Writing files to repo

This chunk will generate a data frame of random numbers and write that to a csv in the repo file. You will then be able to access that file from any computer. 

```{r demo}
df_random <- as.data.frame(matrix(sample(1:99, 40, replace = TRUE), nrow = 4, ncol = 10))

# Print the dataframe
print(df_random)

```

## Writing csv

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
write.csv(df_random, file = 'bluepahldemo.csv')
# blue rocks!
```
